              Problem with NAIS deploy

              Canary application should deploy every 5 minutes, but has not been deployed successfully in over 20 minutes.
            consequence: NAIS deploy is probably unavailable. Some or all users might not be able to deploy
            action: |
              * `kubectl --context management -n nais-system describe job -l app=canary-deployer`
              * `kubectl --context management -n nais-system describe deploy hookd`
              * Ensure deployd is running in cluster that alerts
              * Ensure that hookd and deployd can talk to each other using gRPC
              * Check *hookd*, *deployd* and *naiserator* error logs
